        <h1 className="font-bold text-xl">Can I lose money?</h1>
        <p>There is a risk involved with investing in all high yield investment programs.
           However, there are a few simple ways that can help you to reduce the risk of 
           losing more than you can afford to. First, align your investments with your 
           financial goals, in other words, keep the money you may need for the short-term
            out of more aggressive investments, reserving those investment funds for the money
             you intend to raise over the long-term. It's very important for you to
           know that we are real traders and that we invest members' funds on major investments.</p>
